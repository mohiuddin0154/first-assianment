            <h1>Vission</h1>
            <p>I fell in love with computing and electronics growing up. I like to believe I was born with an innate
                skill to do all these. I fell in love with solving problems . I learnt quickly as I was curious and this
                lead me to experiment more and more. With time
                using a computer or being the family electrician was not a difficult feat.</p>

            <p>Learning syntax is the first step, but it is incredibly important to learn to create readable code.
                Writing code is like writing a paper. Getting the code down and the logic correct is your first draft,
                but what makes good code stand out from bad code is the extra effort put in to revise and reusable.</p>
